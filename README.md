# Notes

Write gpg-encrypted notes.

If you already use `pass`, you will know how to use this tool. It's basically the same commands, but for multiline markdown notes.

## Install

The following dependencies are required:
- gpg
    - REQUIRED: with a default-recipient set in gpg configuration
    - e.g. within `gpg.conf` add a line `default-recipient me@example.com`, or whatever your primary gpg key id is
